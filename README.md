## Smilodon cybertooth
Smilodon, the world's premier password recovery utility, engineered for unparalleled speed and sophistication. Boasting support for five unique modes of attack and hashing algorithms, Smilodon leverages the power of the core, and other hardware accelerators on every O.S in every computer. Its advanced capabilities also facilitate distributed password cracking, making it an indispensable tool for both online and offline scenarios. With Smilodon, recover passwords across diverse ```domains,``` including ```hash-based``` and other complex systems, with unprecedented efficiency and reliability.

### Types of attacks 
- ***Brute-force*** attacks can be very time-consuming because they take a systematic approach to trying all possible permutations of characters in a sequence. The longer the password, the longer it takes. Brute-force attacks are most successful when users have common or weak passwords, which can be “guessed” by tools in a matter of seconds. Of course, Smilodon wouldn't just guess, but more specifically ```'calculate'``` the hash or the target domain.

- ***Dictionary*** attack are similar to brute-force attacks, but they’re less about quantity and more about quality. In other words, instead of trying every possible combination, Smilodon start with the assumption that users are likely to follow certain patterns when they create a password. So they will home in on the most likely words rather than trying everything.

### Surplus 
Supports ```distributed``` password cracking. It can handle various domains, including ***online***, ***offline***, and ***hash-based*** password recovery.
